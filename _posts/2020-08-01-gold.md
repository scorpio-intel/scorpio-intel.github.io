The current rally of gold prices is being promoted by two traditional factors. The first is the ability of gold to hedge against risk. The Coronavirus pandemic has had a severe impact on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that this year, the global economy will shrink by 4.9%. The expectation is that the pandemic is far from over. With the gradual lifting of restrictions in European countries, the vast majority of people are suspicious that a second wave may unfold at some point in the next few weeks and months. The impact on GDP may continue to have an effect in the next few years. 

Secondly, gold can hedge against inflation. Under normal circumstances most investors prefer safe asset such as the 10-year US Treasury note (US10Y) with annual interest rates comparable to gold. However, to support the US economy during this pandemic, The Federal Reserve consistently injects money into the economy and left its federal funds rate unchanged at 0-0.25 percent as of July 29th 2020. The 10 Year Treasury Rate (which is a Longer-term interest rate) has also fallen to some of the lowest levels ever, which was at 0.55% as of 31st July. The Fed currently estimates the 10-year inflation rate at 1.34%. Therefore resulting in a net loss for investors who buy the 10-year Treasury note after accounting for inflation.

The FED has stated that stimulus efforts will last for years to support the economy. The Central banks are printing fresh currency. There has already been over $6 trillion in stimulus injected into the market so far. And this is just the start. That may further lead to inflation. Simultaneously, the dollar index has fallen to just 93, a significant drop in just 4 months. Most analysts forecast that the gold price will definitely cross the $2,000oz mark in the next few months and some predictions state that the gold price could hit $3,500 in two years (according to Barry Dawes of Martin Place Securities).

There are other concerns about the outlook for inflation. The epidemic has led to a deep economic recession and a sharp drop in demand, which may induce deflation in the future. It remains to be seen if central banks can balance out monetary policy in order to control the inflation rate to keep it at a reasonable and preferential level. It would be difficult for gold to show a sustained upward trend under those circumstances.
